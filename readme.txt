Allow users to subscribe to multiple mailing lists and send out mass newsletters to your subscribers using a vast range of features.

== Description ==

Let your members and/or visitors subscribe to multiple mailing lists on your Wordpress front-end by placing a widget in your sidebar, embedding subscriber opt-in forms in your posts and pages or by hardcoding a subscription form directly into your Wordpress theme.

With mailing lists and subscribers in your database, you can immediately jump into sending out mass newsletters, informing your users about the latest content, products, etc... that you have to offer directly from your Wordpress site. But with the ability of telling the plugin to immediately email every post that you publish, you'll be sure that none of your content goes to waste.

Templates allow you to be creative now and put your creation to use at a later stage. With full HTML templates created with a WYSIWYG editor named "FCKEditor", you can insert images, links, blockquotes, font styling and much, much more. When you are ready to send out the template, it takes just a single click to load it into the newsletter sending form.

"installation."  Arbitrary sections will be shown below the built-in sections outlined above.

Titles are optional, naturally.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
